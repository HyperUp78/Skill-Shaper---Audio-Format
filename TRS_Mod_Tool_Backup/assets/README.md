# Assets Directory

Place your game assets, textures, models, and media files here.

## Suggested Organization:

```
assets/
├── textures/             # Texture files (.dds, .tga, .jpg, .png)
├── models/               # 3D models (.x, .3ds, .obj, .dae)
├── audio/                # Audio files (.wav, .mp3, .ogg)
├── fonts/                # Font files (.ttf, .otf)
├── ui/                   # User interface assets
├── screenshots/          # Tool screenshots for reference
└── templates/            # Asset templates and examples
```

## File Types to Include:
- DirectX texture formats (.dds recommended)
- 3D model formats supported by your tool
- Audio files for game sound effects
- UI graphics and icons

## Storage Notes:
