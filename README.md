# Skill-Shaper---Audio-Format
This is a tool that support brand new HQ audio binary format (.SSAF) converting existed Microsoft WAV file

This is Uncompressed codec
Spec:
Channels: 4 (only) (More Wide Stereo than usual)
Bit Rate: 64Bit as PCM Float

When you convert from WAV I recommend 32Bits and 96Khz because 48Khz is not supported.
