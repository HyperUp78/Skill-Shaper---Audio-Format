# Skill-Shaper---Audio-Format
This is a tool that support brand new HQ audio binary format (.SSAF) converting existed Microsoft WAV file

This is Uncompressed codec
Spec:
Channels: 4 (only) (More Wide Stereo than usual)
Bit Rate: 64Bit as PCM Float
Sample Rate: 96Khz

When you convert from WAV I recommend 32Bits and 96Khz because 48Khz is not supported.


Future Updates:
1. More Deeper Sub-Bass and Bass frequencies as Mono
2. Cleaner entire Mid-ranges as possible, more "Limiter Sustain" for mids only
3. A little bit of Wet Reverb as a secondary Layer copy of the same track, so not interfere with main untouched master track.
4. Fixing CPU-made clipping unwanted sounds that are not synced to the actual BPM.
5. Upgrading Player UI
